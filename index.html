        <h2>My name is Kenneth Foutch</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Kenneth Foutch, I am a sophomore at UIW majoring in Computer Science: Programming. Although I am 
        attending college, I am unsure about what I want to do with my degree after I graduate, I assume I will figure it out
        as I go on (especially with the internship required for graduation). Admittedly this was not my first choice of university
        as most of my friends go to UTSA and Texas State, however, because my dad works as a professor at this college, I figured
        it would be worth it to save on money rather than be with my friends all the time. I don't wanna make this too long so I'll
        cut it short here, thanks for visiting my page!</p>

      <p>Sobble is a small lizard-like Pok√©mon. It has light-blue skin with darker teal patches and a lighter blue belly and face. 
      It has similar teal eyes with white pupils and sclerae. Sobble also has a yellow fin on the top of its head bordered in dark 
      blue, as well as a curled blue tail tipped in the same dark blue. Sobble has thin limbs, each of them ending in two curved hands 
      resembling those of a chameleon. It can use these to stick to walls and easily climb them.</p>
